    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>
        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962, and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.

As a child, Tony Stark inherits his family's business, Stark Industries, when his parents are killed in a car crash.[82] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.[15][9] The war zone Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first decades of Iron Man's publication history.[83] This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian country in the 1990s,[84] and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.[85]

        <h2>Personality and motivations</h2>
    <P>
We really thought about how we needed to give him a weakness. It wasn't hip to have him running out of energy and looking for a light socket every few pages, or having a heart attack every time Ultimo was fighting him. So we discussed it and we thought that we would give him the corporate man's disease [alcoholism]. Something that would always haunt him.

Iron Man is a businessman and entrepreneur who seeks to innovate and improve his technology,[6][96] both for society's benefit and his own.[97][98] Iron Man is one of many Marvel heroes with a genius-level intellect,[99] but his focus on societal application alongside hard science distinguishes him from other heroes.[99] The character is a futurist, and he works to identify solutions for problems that have yet to emerge. This preemptive problem solving was a driving force in his organization of the Avengers and later in his support for the Superhero Registration Act during the Civil War event.[100].
