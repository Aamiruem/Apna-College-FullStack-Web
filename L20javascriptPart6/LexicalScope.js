// Lexical Scope
// a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration


// The opposite is NOT true

function outerFunc(){
    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;

    function innerFunc(){
        console.log(x);
    }

// üîç Lexical Scope in JavaScript ‚Äî Simple & Clear Explanation
// ‚úÖ Definition:
// Lexical Scope(also called static scope) means that a function‚Äôs ability to access variables is determined by where it is defined in the code, not where it is called.

// Inner functions can access variables from their outer(parent) functions.

// üß† Think of it like this:
// Scope is decided at the time of writing code, not during execution.

// A function remembers where it was defined, and what variables were around it.

// üìå Example:
// js
// Copy
// Edit
function outer() {
    let message = "Hello from outer!";

    function inner() {
        console.log(message); // ‚úÖ has access to outer's variable
    }

    inner();
}
outer();
// Even though message is not inside inner(), it still works because inner() is defined inside outer().

//     That‚Äôs lexical scope ‚Äî inner functions have access to the lexical environment they were defined in.

// ‚ö†Ô∏è Contrast With Dynamic Scope(Not in JavaScript):
// JavaScript does not use dynamic scope, where variable access is determined by where a function is called.

//     js
// Copy
// Edit
// Not how JS works:
function printName() {
    console.log(name);
}

function caller() {
    let name = "Aamir";
    printName(); // ‚ùå this won't access 'name' from here
}

let name = "Global";
caller(); // ‚úÖ prints "Global" ‚Äî because printName was defined in global scope
// üì¶ Lexical Scope + Closure:
// Lexical scope is what makes closures possible ‚Äî when a function "remembers" its outer variables even after the outer function has finished running.

//     js
// Copy
// Edit
function outer() {
    let count = 0;

    return function inner() {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const counter = outer(); // returns the inner function
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
// ‚úîÔ∏è inner() still remembers count, because of lexical scope.

// ‚úÖ Summary Table:
// Term	Meaning
// Lexical Scope	Scope is based on where code is written
// Inner Function	Can access parent‚Äôs variables
// Closures	Use lexical scope to ‚Äúremember‚Äù values
// When Decided	At definition time, not call time
