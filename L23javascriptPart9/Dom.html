    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
      In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
      head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the
      idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books
      and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As
      with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of
      his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography,
      Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a
      great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee
      stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wallâ€”adding
      in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become
      unsure of whether or not this is true.

        <h2 id="creation-heading">Creation & Development</h2>
        <p>
          In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
          head writer Stan Lee was developing a new superhero concept. The idea for 
          Spider-Man originated from:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A surge in teenage demand for comic books</li>
          <li>The desire to create a relatable teenage protagonist</li>
          <li>Lee's observation of a spider climbing a wall (as frequently recounted)</li>
          <li>Inspiration from the pulp magazine crime fighter "The Spider"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In his autobiography, Lee noted that Spider-Man allowed him to address what 
          he felt was missing in comic books at the time - a hero with everyday problems 
          who wasn't perfect.
